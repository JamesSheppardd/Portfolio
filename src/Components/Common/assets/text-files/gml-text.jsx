            GML (Gamemaker Language) was a language I picked up during school, where we were set a project to make a game over the term, so that weekend I gathered as much knowledge as I could, and made an admittedly 
            bad rendition of a Pacman clone. Nonetheless, I was proud of it. I entered Bafta Young Game Designers competition twice with games made in GML, the more notable being a short rpg where you are set a task 
            to create a brain.

            I am quite confident using GML, but realising itâ€™s limits was one reason I decided to learn C#, and thus the Unity Engine, so will probably not revisit the language anytime soon.
